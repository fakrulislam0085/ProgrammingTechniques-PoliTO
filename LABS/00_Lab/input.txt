You, still inviolate bride of quiet,
Adoptive daughter of slow time and silence,
Silvan narrator, you who tell a flowery tale
Stories, sweeter than my verses,
What inlaid legend of leaves pervades
Your form, are you gods or mortals,
Or both, together, in Tempo or in Arcadia?
And what kind of men are they? What gods? And the shy girls?
What is the mad quest? And the attempted escape?
And the flutes, and the cymbals? What wild ecstasy?
